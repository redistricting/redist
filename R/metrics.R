########################################################

#' Calculate gerrymandering metrics for a set of plans
#'
#' \code{redist.metrics} is used to compute different gerrymandering metrics for a
#' set of maps.
#'
#' @param plans A numeric vector (if only one map) or matrix with one row
#' for each precinct and one column for each map. Required.
#' @param measure A vector with a string for each measure desired from list "DSeats", "DVS", "EffGap",
#' "EffGapEqPop", "TauGap", "MeanMedian", "Bias", "BiasV", "Declination",
#' "Responsiveness", "LopsidedWins", "RankedMarginal", and "SmoothedSeat". Use "all" to get all metrics.
#' "DSeats" and "DVS" are always computed, so it is recommended to always return those values.
#' @param rvote A numeric vector with the Republican vote for each precinct.
#' @param dvote A numeric vector with the Democratic vote for each precinct.
#' @param draw A numeric to specify draw number. Defaults to 1 if only one map provided
#' and the column number if multiple maps given. Can also take a factor input, which will become the
#' draw column in the output if its length matches the number of entries in plans. If the `plans` input
#' is a `redist_plans` object, it extracts the `draw` identifier.
#' @param tau A non-negative number for calculating Tau Gap. Only used with option "TauGap". Defaults to 1.
#' @param biasV A value between 0 and 1 to compute bias at. Only used with option "BiasV". Defaults to 0.5.
#' @param respV A value between 0 and 1 to compute responsiveness at. Only used with option "Responsiveness". Defaults to 0.5.
#' @param bandwidth A value between 0 and 1 for computing responsiveness. Only used with option "Responsiveness." Defaults to 0.01.
#' @param ncores Number of cores to use for parallel computing. Default is 1.
#'
#'
#' @details This function computes specified compactness scores for a map.  If
#' there is more than one precinct specified for a map, it aggregates to the district level
#' and computes one score.
#'
#' DSeats is computed as the expected number of Democratic seats with no change in votes.
#' DVS is the Democratic Vote Share, which is the two party vote share with Democratic votes as the numerator.
#' EffGap is the Efficiency Gap, calculated with votes directly.
#' EffGapEqPop is the Efficiency Gap under an Equal Population assumption, calculated with the DVS.
#' TauGap is the Tau Gap, computed with the Equal Population assumption.
#' MeanMedian is the Mean Median difference.
#' Bias is the Partisan Bias computed at 0.5.
#' BiasV is the Partisan Bias computed at value V.
#' Declination is the value of declination at 0.5.
#' Responsiveness is the responsiveness at the user-supplied value with the user-supplied bandwidth.
#' LopsidedWins computed the Lopsided Outcomes value, but does not produce a test statistic.
#' RankedMarginal computes the Ranked Marginal Deviation (0-1, smaller is better). This is also known
#' as the "Gerrymandering Index" and is sometimes presented as this value divided by 10000.
#' SmoothedSeat computes the Smoothed Seat Count Deviation (0-1, smaller is R Bias, bigger is D Bias).
#'
#' @return A tibble with  a column for each specified measure and
#' a column that specifies the map number.
#'
#' @importFrom dplyr select %>% tibble

#' data(fl25)
