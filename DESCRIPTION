Description: Enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a pre-specified
    target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    algorithms.  The package allows for the implementation of various constraints in
    the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity
    requirements. Tools for analysis such as computation of various summary statistics
    and plotting functionality are also included. The package implements methods
    described in Fifield, Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2020) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2020.1739532>,
    Fifield, Imai, Kawahara, and Kenny (2020) <doi:10.1080/2330443X.2020.1791773>,
    and McCartan and Imai (2020) <arXiv:2008.06131>.
