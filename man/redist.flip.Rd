\item{adj}{adjacency matrix, list, or object of class
"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame."}

\item{total_pop}{A vector containing the populations of each geographic
unit}

\item{nsims}{The number of simulations run before a save point.}

\item{ndists}{The number of congressional districts. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{init_plan}{A vector containing the congressional district labels
of each geographic unit. If not provided, random and contiguous congressional
district assignments will be generated using \code{redist.smc}. To use the old
behavior of generating with \code{redist.rsg}, provide init_plan = 'rsg'.}

\item{loopscompleted}{Number of save points reached by the
algorithm. The default is \code{0}.}

\item{nloop}{The total number of save points for the algorithm. The

default is \code{1}.}

each iteration of the algorithm. The number of swaps each iteration is
equal to Pois(\code{lambda}) + 1. The default is \code{0}.}

\item{pop_tol}{The strength of the hard population
constraint. \code{pop_tol} = 0.05 means that any proposed swap that
brings a district more than 5\% away from population parity will be
rejected. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{group_pop}{A vector of populations for some sub-group of
interest. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{areasvec}{A vector of precinct areas for discrete Polsby-Popper.
The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{counties}{A vector of county membership assignments. The default is \code{NULL}.}

the first two columns are the indices of precincts sharing a border and
the third column is its distance. Default is \code{NULL}.}

units. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{temper}{Whether to use simulated tempering algorithm. Default is FALSE.}

\item{constraint}{Which constraint to apply. Accepts any combination of \code{compact},
\code{segregation}, \code{vra}, \code{population}, \code{similarity}, \code{partisan},
\code{minority}, \code{hinge}, \code{countysplit}, or \code{none}
(no constraint applied). The default is NULL.}

\item{constraintweights}{The weights to apply to each constraint. Should be a vector
the same length as constraint. Default is NULL.}

\item{compactness_metric}{The compactness metric to use when constraining on
compactness. Default is \code{fryer-holden}, the other implemented options
are \code{polsby-popper} and \code{edges-removed}.}

Only implemented is "efficiency-gap", the default.}

\item{ssd_denom}{The normalizing constant for the sum-of-squared distance Fryer-Holden metric.
Default is 1.0 (unnormalized).}

\item{betaseq}{Sequence of beta values for tempering. The default is
\code{powerlaw} (see Fifield et. al (2015) for details).}

\item{betaseqlength}{Length of beta sequence desired for
tempering. The default is \code{10}.}

\item{betaweights}{Sequence of weights for different values of
beta. Allows the user to upweight certain values of beta over
others. The default is \code{NULL} (equal weighting).}

\item{adjswaps}{Flag to restrict swaps of beta so that only
values adjacent to current constraint are proposed. The default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{rngseed}{Allows the user to set the seed for the
simulations. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{maxiterrsg}{Maximum number of iterations for random seed-and-grow
algorithm to generate starting values. Default is 5000.}

acceptance probability falls between 20\% and 40\%. Default is FALSE.}

Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability falls between 20\% and 40\%. Default is
FALSE.}

Metropolis-Hastings ratio calculation for accept-reject rule. Default is FALSE.}

\item{savename}{Filename to save simulations. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print initialization statement.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{tgt_min}{The majority minority target percent as a decimal. Default is 0.55.}

\item{tgt_other}{The remaining target percent as a decimal. Default is 0.25.}

\item{rvote}{integer vector of votes for Republicans by precinct}

\item{minorityprop}{numeric vector of targeted minority proportions for the top
districts with that proportion}

\code{redist} is a list that contains the following components (the
inclusion of some components is dependent on whether tempering
techniques are used):

corresponds to a simulation.}

\description{
\code{redist.mcmc} is used to simulate Congressional redistricting
plans using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
}
\details{
This function allows users to simulate redistricting plans
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Several constraints
corresponding to substantive requirements in the redistricting process
are implemented, including population parity and geographic
compactness. In addition, the function includes multiple-swap and
simulated tempering functionality to improve the mixing of the Markov
Chain.

## Get an initial partition
